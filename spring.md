 # Spring
    
_First_ Came the rain, loud, with sonorous lips;

A pursuivant who heralded a prince:

And dawn put on her livery of tints,

And dusk bound gold about her hair and hips:

And, all in silver mail, the sunlight came,

A knight, who bade the winter let him pass;

And freed imprisoned beauty, naked as

The Court of Love, in all her wildflower shame.

And so she came, in breeze-borne loveliness,

Across the hills; and heav'n bent down to bless:

Above her head the birds were as a lyre;

And at her feet, like some strong worshipper,

The shouting water p√¶n'd praise of her

Who, with blue eyes, set the wild world on fire.
