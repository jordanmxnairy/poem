 #Spring
    
    First Came the rain, loud, with sonorous lips;
    _A pursuivant who heralded a prince_
    And dawn put on her livery of tints,
    And dusk bound gold about her hair and hips:
    And, all in silver mail, the sunlight came,
    A knight, who bade the winter let him pass;
    
    **And freed imprisoned beauty, naked as**
    The Court of Love, in all her wildflower shame.
    And so she came, in breeze-borne loveliness,
    Across the hills; and heav'n bent down to bless:
    
    __Above her head the birds were as a lyre;__
    And at her feet, like some strong worshipper,
    The shouting water p√¶n'd praise of her
    *Who, with blue eyes, set the wild world on fire*
